command converts simple operations or requests to objects.
Each command is an object , we will have executors/invokers we will have receivers/where the execution is happening 
The conversion allows deferred or remote execution of commands, storing command history, etc.

example:
restarurant - receivers with actual business logic
cooks - executors (will have bunch of command objects embedded to them)
commands - (make pizza,make salad,clean dishes) commands will have receivers embedded into them
